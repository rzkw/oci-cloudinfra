## Getting Started

This project demos a small but secure, isolated cloud infrastructure on Oracle Cloud using industry standard best practices: network segmentation and identity/access management (IAM). Practical use cases for this setup include a test environment for a dev agency, students learning IT/Computer Science and e-commerce business inventory/analytics.

### What You'll Learn

* Building a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) with public & private subnets
* Implementing Bastion service for secure SSH access
* Configuring cross-domain IAM policies
* Setting up NAT Gateway for outbound connectivity
* Enabling security controls and audit logging

### Prerequisites

* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account (Free Tier or Pay As You Go)
* An understanding of networking fundamentals (CIDR blocks, subnets, routing)
* Some familiarity with the Linux command line
